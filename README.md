# clustering by Genetic Algorithm and KMeans Clustering
- This project involves implementing the KMeans clustering algorithm to predict cluster labels on iris dataset.
- Also it implements genetic algorith for clustering. 
- Calculates the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to evaluate the clustering performance.
- The project is implemented in Python
